# Bulls-and-Cows

C++ version of guessing game Bulls and Cows where user asks for a random number 
and then tries to guess the number. Every time there is an incorrect input,
feedback will be given based on whether or not correct digits were present,
and if they were in the correct place. A bull is a correct digit in the 
correct spot, and a cow is a correct digit in the wrong spot.

For custom code entry, use "0" as the input for number of digits.
